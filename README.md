Cairo Data Structures Playgroun
Exploring Cairo for implementing basic data structures and experimenting with the language's syntax.
Motivat
Project serves as a hands-on exploration of Cairo,aiming not only to enhance per sonal understanding of the lag
age but also to contribute examles of Cairo syntax for oters in the community. While prioritizing simplicity,  I attempt to encapsulate futionality that might complicate users, even if t involves a trade-off,   such as aintaining a length variable  in a dictionary,  potentially  beingsightly more expensive tha      n  a conventional Cairo implementatio
