Cairo Data Structures Playground
Exploring Cairo for implementing basic data structures and experimenting with the language's syntax.
Motivat
Project serves as a hands-on exploration of Cairo, aiming not only to enhance per sonal understanding of the lag
age but also to contribute examles of Cairo syntax for oters in the community. While prioritizing simplicity,  I attempt to encapsulate futionality that might complicate users, even if t involves a trade-off, such as aintaining a length variable in a dictionary, potentially  beingslightly more expensive than  a conventional Cairo implementatio
